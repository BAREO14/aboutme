  <h2>Apart from <u>coding</u>, there are other things I
    enjoy doing and they include writing songs,
    frestyling and spending time with <mark>friends</mark>.

    <p>I'm tring to stay focused and acqquire this 
      skill and do away with <s>distractions</s>.It's not going to be <i>easy</i>, but God dey.
    </p>
    <p>One more thing, I <s>deleted</s> the app I created and started over from 
      comm. prompt up to three times before I could <b>Finally</b> get this done.
    </p>
    <p>But it feels so good finally being able to do this, thanks to our captain, miss Tosin.</p>
